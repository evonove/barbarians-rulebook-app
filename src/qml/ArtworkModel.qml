peace. Otherwise, if he thinks somebody doesn’t deserves this,
he lets them fall to the burning ground, where all the other
damned souls live."

living in strange amulets, and then buries them inside her pyramid
where she honors Cerlus, Goddess of deer, antelope and all running
animals. No living human has ever seen her temple, perched on a
steep cliff where impetuous waves continuously clash."

        description: "Warmaiden Haona is a beautiful and statuesque woman, but
immoral and foolish at the same time. Her wicked nature
however, comes from the starlike sapphire set in the luxurious
crown that she wears. Due to some sort of bi-refractory
state created by the stone, she is unable to see things clearly.
Everything appears to her in double, making her incapable
of discerning between good and evil, right and wrong, beautiful
and horrendous, and even life and death.
Why wear such a treacherous object then? Because it gives her
unimaginable powers, worthy of the mightiest Barbarian
leaders, the ability to generate extraordinary forces capable of
destroying and manipulating to her will any human creation.

that was originally a faithful priestess. She is intent on draining the life
from two slaves through a sacred ritual, and channeling the ethereal flux
inside a cursed receptacle. Two fierce wild beasts at the Warmaiden’s side are
ready to devour the human flesh that will be offered to Zang, Goddess of wolves.
Sacred rituals are an important aspect of combat in Fenian, since even the
strongest army could succumb to the powers gifted by a God."
