            Enter the mysterious World of Fenian, a place where barbarian clans rule wild lands and corrupted civilizations live in decaying cities - a place filled with powers gifted by ancient gods and treacherous demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Become a Warlord and lead your clan on the conquest of civilized nations. Take their lands and steal their riches.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will need a strong economy and an even stronger army. You will have to manage resources and construct buildings, but you will be able to summon the power of ancient gods and demons to gain temporary magical benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only the strongest clan will prevail on the path to glory, leaving its mark in history.
