            Enter the mysterious World of Fenian, a place where barbarian clans rule wild lands and corrupted civilizations live in decaying cities - a place filled with powers gifted by ancient gods and treacherous demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Become a Warlord and lead your clan on the conquest of civilized nations. Take their lands and steal their riches.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will need a strong economy and an even stronger army. You will have to manage resources and construct buildings, but you will be able to summon the power of ancient gods and demons to gain temporary magical benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only the strongest clan will prevail on the path to glory, leaving its mark in history.

          <h2>Set Up</h2>
          <p>
            The setup is the same as the base game, except for the following changes:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1a.</b> Use the cardboard cutout pieces of the expansion in place of the rings provided in the base game.
            Randomly choose 4 Magma Tokens and place them face-up on four different sectors, one in each ring.

            <h4>Hunt</h4>
            <p>
              If, immediately after a Skullcrusher action, your Skullcrusher is on a region containing a Hunt Marker, you can try to hunt down a Beast or Monster. First you can recruit troops as in a War action. When you are done, look at the face-up card in the Beasts and Monsters display corresponding to the region your Skullcrusher is on. The card tells you how many battles you have to face. (e.g.: If your Skullcrusher is on a Forest region containing the Hunt Marker, and the Snake of the Forest is visible on the display, you can hunt it. In order to hunt down the Snake of the Forest, you need to  ght two battles - drawing cards from the Forest region deck).<br>
              Flip simultaneously all the region cards you have to face. You can decide to pay the total cost of gray troops indicated on the cards to capture the creature, or pay nothing and return all the revealed cards to their deck.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>
                Note: These are not standard battles. No rewards or Overkill are possible during this action. Moreover, you can’t use any bonuses (such as Defense Track Knowledge, Warchief cards, or Beast power).

            </div>
            <p>
              At the end of a Hunt, two outcomes are possible:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>You can’t or don’t want to pay the total cost of troops:</b> the creature escapes, and the hunt fails.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>You pay the total cost of troops:</b> you have either tamed the beast or collected the trophy of the monster.<br>
              - Take the Beast (or Monster) card you defeated and put it in front of you.<br>
              <i>OR</i><br>
              - Immediately score the Domination points indicated on the top-right of the card, multiplied by the number indicated next to the island where you hunted it.

          <h2>Set Up</h2>
          <p>
            The setup is the same as the base game, except for the following changes:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2a.</b> Set up the map.<br>
            Return the faction tokens in the regions marked “3+” and “4+” to the gamebox.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4a.</b> Randomly draw 10 God, 10 Warchief and 14 Building cards; and shuffle them all together in a single deck. Place this deck close to the gameboard. Return all the other cards to the gamebox. Now reveal the top 7 cards and place them in a row beside the deck. This forms the display area.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>6a.</b> Take the Champions of one non-player color and place those Champions on four random action spaces of the Volcano, one in each ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>7a.</b> Draw a random God card from the unused God cards and keep it face up. Then advance your Domination point counter by the amount indicated on the top-right corner of that God card.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>8a.</b> In any order, stack your Honor track counter and the Honor track counter of the non-player color on the starting space of the Honor track.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>9a.</b> Place 2 of your Knowledge discs in the leftmost space of two different Knowledge tracks or 1 disc in the second space of a single Knowledge track.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>10a.</b> Shuffle the Fate cards and form a deck face-down beside your player gameboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>11a.</b> Choose the difficulty of your game:<br>
            Easy: 80 Domination Points<br>
            Normal: 100 Domination Points<br>
            Hard: 130 Domination Points<br>
            Insane: 150 Domination Points<br>
            Custom: Choose on your own.<br>
            Record: The highest number of Domination Points you scored in a solo-game.

          <p>
            The game follows the same rules as the base game, except for the following changes:
          </p>
          <p>
            The game lasts a maximum of 6 Eras, with each Era running the same way.<br>
            Pre-phase<br>
            1st Phase: Maintenance<br>
            2nd Phase: Action<br>

            <h4>Pre-phase</h4>
            <p>
              Before the Maintenance phase, shuffle the Fate deck and draw the top card.
              Then immediately resolve all the effects indicated, from top to bottom.

                  Check the Map to identify the regions targetable by the non-player color. They must respect these conditions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The region is adjacent to an already conquered region — it doesn’t matter if it was conquered by you or by a non-player color — or to the starting region.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The region has a Faction token on it.

                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Among the targetable regions, pick the one with the Faction token of the left-most Faction indicated. In case there are none, look for the second left-most Faction indicated, and so on until you find a valid Faction token.<br>
                In case there are multiple valid Faction tokens, pick the one with the highest Domination point value.
                Place a non-player color Banner on that region, and return the Faction token to the gamebox.
